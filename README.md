# lazyvercel

A beautiful Terminal User Interface (TUI) for managing Vercel deployments, built with Bun and OpenTUI.

## Features

- 📋 View and filter deployments by branch
- 🔍 Search deployments with real-time updates
- 📊 View deployment details and build logs
- 🎨 Catppuccin theme with syntax highlighting
- ⚡ Real-time log streaming for active builds
- 🚀 Fast and lightweight single executable

## Installation

```bash
bunx lazyvercel
```

Or install globally with bun:

```bash
bun install -g lazyvercel
```

And run with

```bash
lazyvercel
```

## Setup

On first run, you'll be prompted to configure your Vercel API token:

1. Visit [Vercel Account Tokens](https://vercel.com/account/tokens)
2. Click "Create Token"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Vercel TUI")
4. Select appropriate scopes (read access to projects and deployments)
5. Copy the generated token
6. Paste it into the setup (needs bun >= 1.3.0)

The token will be securely stored in `~/.config/lazyvercel/config.json`.

For more information about Vercel API authentication, see the [official documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/reference/welcome#authentication).

## Usage

Run the TUI from any Vercel project directory:

```bash
bunx lazyvercel
```

The TUI will automatically detect your project from the `.vercel/project.json` file.
